I always have a terminal occupying the lower half of the screen, in my 2nd monitor (vertical),
with a [tmux] session splitted horizontally.

I always have [htop] in the upper part and [nethogs] in the lower part.

```bash
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|..........|
|..........|

```
